# language-interpreter

## Functionality of the Language
The programming language implemented by this interpreter is designed to provide a simple and flexible platform for writing and executing programs. Here is a brief overview of the key features and functionality supported by the language:

## Data Types and Typing
The language supports basic data types such as int/float/string/bool. Variables can be declared using let or const keywords and assigned values using the standard syntax. One unique feature of this language is that it has weak typing, which means that the type of an expression can be automatically changed if the context requires it.

## Control Flow
The language provides several constructs for controlling the flow of execution in a program, including:

If/Else statements: for branching based on a condition

While loops: for executing a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true

Pattern Matching: a mechanism that allows for more expressive and versatile pattern matching than traditional switch statements in other programming languages

## Functions
Functions can be defined using the function keyword, followed by the function name and parameter list. The body of the function is then indented and executed when the function is called. The language allows for the creation and use of functions and includes support for passing variables by reference or value.

## Error Handling
The language includes basic support for error handling.
